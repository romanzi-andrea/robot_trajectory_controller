# robot_trajectory_controller
I developed a trajectory tracker (feedback linearization + 2 PI) for a car-like robot using ROS. The overall apparatus is tested on 2 different simulators for the robot, one based on the kinematic and the other on the dynamic model (it is possible to choose between linear tyre model and Fiala tyre model)
